The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on July 03, Saturday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1

Started a [Tip Calculator App](https://github.com/watersro/Tip-Calculator), and started learning Ruby!

### R1D2

Continued solving [The Odin Project's Javascript Excercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises) and learning Ruby - Ruby definitely feels more straightforward.

### R1D3

Unfortunately had to miss a few days, but back to it with a [Javascript Calculator!](https://github.com/watersro/calc).

### R1D4

Continuing with my Ruby studies, and played around with enumerable and predicate enumerable methods.

### R1D5

Made a [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/watersro/ruby-intro-problems) in Ruby!

### R1D6

Did some multi-dimensional Array and hash sorting.

### R1D7

Worked on bash scripts for my bug bounty automation.

### R1D8

Refactoring some old code and scripts, making them more inline with the DRY phillosphy.

### R1D9

Made a [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/watersro/tic-tac-toe) app in Ruby!

### R1D10

Worked further on the Mastermind game.

### R1D11

Finished the player-breaks-code mode in Mastermind game.

### R1D12

Struggled with the Computer breaking code for the Mastermind game.

### R1D13

Finished the computer breaking code and the Mastermind game. The AI is slightly overpowered and so I will probably have to revisit later.

### R1D14

No projects, learnt about serialisation and got my mind blown.

### R1D15

Started making a Hangman game with save file functionality

### R1D16

Completed the basic Hangman game structure (turns, word guessing, showing the player correct/incorrect guesses)

### R1D17

Added save functionality into the Hangman game. Saves using JSON

### R1D18

Added the load functionality into the Hangman game, as well as some clean up.

### R1D19

Learnt about custom enumerables and pattern matching.

### R1D20

Continued with custom enumerables and pattern matching

### R1D21

Continued with pattern matching and custom enumerables, have decided to revisit at a later date as I'm definitely not 100 percent.

### R1D22

Learnt about data structures and algorithms. Solved some basic-ish problems using recursion.
